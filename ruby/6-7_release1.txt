# create word-guessing game
# make a class
# driver code will handle
    # input: one user creates word or phrase
        # another attempts to guess that word or phrase
            # User guesses are limited relative to the
            # length of the word
                # unless its a repeated guess
            
    # output: each input will give feedback on current
    # progress of the word
